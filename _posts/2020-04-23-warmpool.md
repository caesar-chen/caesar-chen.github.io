Recently I watched an interesting talk, which explained an idea of Warm Pool, might help to reduce the auto scaling time. Here is the summary:

[ ![Warm Pool](\assets\post_pics\warmpool.png) ](\assets\post_pics\warmpool.png)

1. We maintain a single ASG as warm pool.
2. When our ECS cluster needs more instance (i.e., time to scale up), we detach the EC2 instance from the Warm Pool ASG and register into the cluster which needs it.
3. Since ASG has the feature to replace the instance when you detach, the pool is always nice and full.
4. The instance assigned to the ECS cluster will be started very fast.
5. We can detach and pull more instances from Warm Pool if needed.
6. We can terminate instances after use (i.e., time to scale down)

Depends on the service, but usually an ECS service will take around 6 minutes to scale up during auto scaling event. While around 1.5 minutes are spent for configuring new EC2 instances. (Sorry cannot disclose the breakdown, as it's sensitive info).

With the help of Warm Pool, we can reduce around 25% auto scaling time.
